Solution:
The first observation to be made is that the string at depth n
can be constructed by taking the string at depth n-1 and then
appending an L and then appending the string at depth n-1 reversed
and with all L's changed to R's and all R's changed to L's.

Given that the string can be constructed in this manner, and that
the substring that we are working with has a maximum length of 100,
we can obtain the answer through the following method:

Let s(n) be the string at depth n, and let b be the substring that
we are trying to find in s(n). Let the 'reverseFlip of b' be the
string obtained by reversing b and switch L's for R's and R's for L's.

b will appear either entirely in the first half of s(n), or entirely
in the right half of s(n), or it will lie in the middle 201
characters of s(n), or it will not appear in s(n) at all.
If b appears entirely in the left half of s(n) then it can be found
in s(n-1).
If b appears entirely in the right half of s(n) then its reverseFlip
will be found in s(n-1).
We can compute the middle 201 characters for each depth of s(i), i<=n. 
So check if there is a match for b in these 201 characters for s(n). 
If there is no match then we assume that b was either entirely in the
left half or entirely in the right half of s(n) and we proceed to check
if b or its reverseFlip can be found in s(n-1) through the same process.
If we do find a match for b in the middle 201 characters then we stop
because we have found that b is a substring of s(n).
If we do not find a match for b or its reverseFlip at any depth less 
than n then b cannot possibly be a substring of s(n).

Note that the middle 201 characters for s(n) remain constant for
n>10, since |s(n)|>201 for n>10. As such, for values of n greater than
10, we can treat n as being equal to 10.
